# Site-Savvy Card Game - Printing Instructions

This document provides guidance on how to print and prepare the Site-Savvy card game for play.

## Card Quantities

For an optimal game experience, print the following quantities:

| Card Type | Print Each Page | Total Cards |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Role Cards | 2 times | 38 cards |
| Service Cards | 3 times | 54 cards |
| Advantage Cards (Green) | 2 times | 12 cards |
| Disadvantage Cards (Red) | 2 times | 12 cards |

## Printing Tips

### Color vs. Black & White
While the cards are designed with colors that correspond to different OSI layers, the game is fully playable in black and white. The shapes (squares, triangles, diamonds, etc.) provide the same information as the colors, making the game accessible for:

- Black and white printers
- Players with color vision deficiencies
- Low-cost printing options

### Card Stock
For best results:
- Use cardstock paper (65-110 lb / 176-298 gsm)
- Print double-sided if possible (blank on back or with a back design)
- Consider laminating cards for durability if the game will see frequent use

### Print Settings
- Print at actual size (100% scale)
- Use high-quality settings for clearer text and shapes
- Test print one page first to ensure proper alignment

## Assembly Instructions

1. Print all card pages according to the quantities listed above
2. Cut along the marked lines (use a paper cutter for best results)
3. If not printing double-sided, consider using card sleeves
4. Store different card types separately until ready to play

## Alternative Printing Methods

### Print-on-Demand Services
You can use print-on-demand services like:

- [MakePlayingCards](https://www.makeplayingcards.com)

### Local Print Shops
Many local print shops can print on cardstock and cut to size. Bring digital files on a USB drive or send via email.

## Special Notes

- The instruction/reference card should be printed once per deck
- For classroom use, consider printing multiple complete sets
- For larger groups (6+ players), you may want to print additional copies of Role and Service cards
