![Site-Savvy Logo](resources/site-savvy-logo.png)

## 🎯 Objective
Be the first player to play all your cards! Along the way, you'll build your understanding of web infrastructure and IT systems.

## 🎴 Card Types & Count
- **Role Cards:** 19 unique roles (38 cards in deck)
- **Service Cards:** 18 unique services (54 cards in deck)
- **Advantage Cards (Green):** 6 cards
- **Disadvantage Cards (Red):** 6 cards

## 🧩 Color & Shape System
Each layer in IT architecture is represented by a unique color and shape:

| Color & Shape | IT Domain | OSI Layers |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Brown ■ | Physical Infrastructure | Layers 1-3 |
| Orange ▲ | Network Connectivity | Layers 1-4 |
| Yellow ◆ | Data & Storage | Layers 1-7 |
| Green ⬢ | Software & Applications | Layers 5-7 |
| Blue ● | User Interface | Layers 5-7 |
| Purple ★ | Data Processing | Layers 1-7 |
| Pink ♥ | Security & Access | Layers 1-7 |

## 🎮 Setup
1. Shuffle all cards together
2. Deal cards based on player count:
   - 2-3 players: 7 cards each
   - 4-5 players: 5 cards each
   - 6+ players: 3-4 cards each
3. Place remaining cards face-down as the draw pile
4. Flip the top card to start the discard pile (if it's red or green, draw another)

## 📋 How to Play

### On Your Turn:
1. **Play a matching card** on the discard pile by:
   - Matching a color/shape, OR
   - Matching a Role to Service with compatible OSI layers
2. **If you can't play**, draw one card and play it if possible
3. **When you have one card left**, say "Site-Savvy!" (If you forget, draw two cards as penalty)
4. **Special play**: If you match the first color of a Service card, you get to play again!

### Special Cards:

#### Service Cards
- Show different IT services with three colors/shapes
- Can be matched by any of their three colors
- The first color represents the primary technology domain

#### Role Cards
- Represent IT professionals
- Match by color/shape
- Can counter red cards with the same OSI layer

#### Red Cards (Disadvantage)
- Cause problems for other players
- Can be counteracted if played on a Service card and the next player has a Role card in the same OSI layer

#### Green Cards (Advantage)
- Give you special benefits
- Follow the card instructions, then end your turn

## 🔄 Advanced Play
For educational gameplay, consider how different services work together. After the game, discuss which IT roles and services would interact in real-world scenarios.
